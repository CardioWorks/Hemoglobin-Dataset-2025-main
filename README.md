Welcome to the "Hemoglobin-PPG Dataset Research". This package offers the data screening, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation and statistical analysis of four wavelengths photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for technical validation. It operates on MathWorks MATLAB R2023b.

"ppg_screening.m": PPG screening and noise segments removal.

"SNR_ppg.m": SNR calculation algorithm for four wavelengths PPG signals.

"statistical_analysis.m": Statistical analysis between different PPG wavelengths, including statistical power, effect size, confidence interval calculation.

"SNR_data.xlsx": Statistical data of SNR calculation.
